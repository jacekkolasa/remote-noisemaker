# remote-noisemaker (work in progress) 
[http://jacekkolasa.github.io/remote-noisemaker/](http://jacekkolasa.github.io/remote-noisemaker/)
Quick app to try and test cycle.js library. Backed by Firebase. Plays noise from one browser and let you control it from another. 
Could be used if your infant have sleeping problems. :)
You can start the application on your phone, place it near children's bed, and control the volume
from other computer. There is bonus option (really useful) for applying a very slow fadeout.
